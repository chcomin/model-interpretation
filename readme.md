### Some experiments regarding model interpretation

* Notebook `2D visualizations and the logistic model` contains some projection methods (PCA, t-SNE and UMAP) that can be used for visualizing the MNIST dataset as well as visualizations of the decision boundary of the logistic model when applied to the MNIST dataset.

* Notebook `Logistic interpretation` contains some visualizations of the weights of a logistic model applied to the MNIST dataset.

* Notebook `CNN interpretation` shows two possible approaches for interpreting neural networks: a) discovering image patches that maximally activate a given filter; b) visualizing the filter activations that contributed the most to the class score of an image.

* Notebook `Train sparse models` shows an example of training a sparse model with L1 regularization.
